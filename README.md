## Spin Language Support Matrix

This repo is to track Spin SDK support for various programming languages.  Each
language is represented by a module designed to be tested using the
[`spin-conformance`](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/tree/main/crates/conformance)
utility.  The result is a table that shows which Spin features each language SDK
supports, updated automatically via a GitHub action, allowing anyone to track
development progress in "real time".
